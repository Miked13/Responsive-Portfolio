                    Mike Diallo comes from Corvalis, Oregon and graduated from Savannah State University 
                    with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. At Savannah State, Mike attended the 
                    International Student's Association as a way to participate in extracurricular activities,
                    where he learned how to organise a parade.</p>

                    After graduation, Mike did some internship overseas before moving to Atlanta, GA where he is 
                    motivated to start a career in the tech industry. Outside of studies or job, he likes to watch
                    netflix movies or tv series, anime and soccer games. From time to time he also plays video games
                    with his friends online.</p>
